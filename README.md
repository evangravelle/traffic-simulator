# traffic-simulator

This is a microscopic traffic simulator, focused on accurately modeling intersections, written in MATLAB  
Warning, it is messy, written by Evan Gravelle, 2016

MainScript.m runs main simulation, should work out of the box  
LoopMain.m allows multiple runs of MainScript.m, must change parameters in MainScript.m to save things  
MiscFunctions contains functions called by MainScript.m  
PlotScripts contains scripts to generate various plots
