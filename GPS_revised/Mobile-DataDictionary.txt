GPS dataset
File Name: Mobile-GPS.csv
Format: Comma Delimited Text File

NMEA Sentence Code - NMEA standard that defines the interpretation of the data contained in each row. All entries are Global Positioning Recommended Minimum C, identified as $GPRMC. This field will always be in column 1.

UTC Time - Timestamp of the data point in UTC time. Format is hhmmss. Leading zeroes are not included. This field will always be in column 2. Please note that local time in San Diego, CA, is not always UTC-8 hours, due to daylight savings. It is UTC-8 from Jan 1, 2010 to Mar 13, 2010, UTC-7 from Mar 14, 2010 to Nov 7, 2010, and UTC-8 from Nov 8, 2010 to Dec 31, 2010

Status - A for active or V for void. If void, the GPS may have still been searching for satellites and a good connection could not be made. This field will always be in column 3.

Latitude - NMEA-format latitude value. This field will always be in column 4.

Latitude Direction - NMEA-format latitude direction value. This field will always be in column 5.

Longitude - NMEA-format longitude value. This field will always be in column 6.

Longitude Direction - NMEA-format longitude direction value. This field will always be in column 7.

Speed (knots) - Speed over the ground in knots. This field will always be in column 8.

Track Angle (degrees true) - Track angle in degrees True format. 0 degrees is True North. This field will always be in column 9.

Date - UTC date of data point. Format is ddmmyy. Leading zeroes are not included. Please note that the UTC date can be one day ahead of local date, depending on the time of day. This field will always be in column 10.

Magnetic Variation - degrees. This field will always be in column 11. However, this field could be empty if the manufacturer of the GPS device does not capture and relay this information. 
Magnetic Variation Direction - E or W. This field will always be in column 12. However, this field could be empty if the manufacturer of the GPS device does not capture and relay this information.

FAA mode indicator - Optional (NMEA 2.3 and later) A = Autonomous mode,  D = Differential Mode, E = Estimated (dead-reckoning) mode, M = Manual Input Mode, S = Simulated Mode,  N = Data Not Valid. If included, it will be column 13. Some GPS devices do not report this field.

Checksum - The checksum data, always begins with *. If FAA mode indicator optional field is not included, this field would be in column 13, otherwise in column 14. Use * as a field separator to correctly identify this field value.  

Description: Original 2010 ALK GPS data for San Diego Metropolitan Area. This data is collected at typically 3-second intervals from users of CoPilot (ALK's in-vehicle navigation product), with their consent to collect and distribute.  These data from GPS-receivers are in NMEA sentence format and includes no personal information.  ALK has ensured that all user-specific information that could be traced back to a particular individual CoPilot user has been removed from the dataset. Neither ALK nor anyone will be able to trace back the GPS data to the original traveler. 

The GPS dataset is in standard NMEA-format output by the mobile device. In many cases, the 12th column is empty and FAA mode indicator and Checksum both occupy the 13th column with no separating comma. This is the unmodified format in which the data was originally collected. ALK does not recommend altering this industry standard format for the GPS files.  

GGD dataset
File Name: Mobile-GGD.csv
Format: Comma Delimited Text File

Trip ID - Unique number for an Origin-Destination pair. This number refers to the number in the file name of the Mobile-GPS dataset. 

Sequence Number - Sequence number of GPS tracks for the trip in the direction of travel. Number is assigned after some tracks have been excluded for privacy reasons.

Timestamp - Timestamp in local time. Format is mm/dd/yyyy hh:mm:ss.sss.

Latitude - Latitude in decimal degrees.

Longitude - Longitude in decimal degrees.

Speed (mph) - Speed in mph.

Heading (degrees) - Heading angle in degrees.

ALK Grid ID - ALK digital map grid ID.

ALK Link ID - ALK digital map link ID unique to ALK Grid ID.

Direction of Travel - 1 indicates A -> B direction of the link. 2 indicates B -> A direction of the link.

Map Match Weight - Confidence on the map-matched link (1 to 100, higher number implies better matching). 

Percent on the Link - Indicates point along the link from A-Node to B-Node where the GPS data is matched. 75.24 indicates 75.24% from A-Node and 24.76% from B-Node. This is independent of the direction of travel.

Description: GGD is an ALK format and it stands for Gridded GPS track Data. It is a cleaned GPS dataset that is map-matched to ALK Digital Maps, and broken into individual trip segments by individual contributors. The only identifier is an integer trip number.  An individual trip is assumed to commence at the first location for a new GPS track as well as for any location for which the time since the previous location is greater than 4 minutes.  The end of a trip segment is identified as either the last GPS data point for a track or the last GPS point prior to a 4 minute gap. 

In addition to position, speed, heading, date and time, the data in this file also contain fields that tell where on which link of ALK's digital map network each GPS observation corresponds. The latitude/longitude values in the GGD file are the same as included in the corresponding GPS files. 
 
Additional documentation for Map Match Weight: For each GPS observation, ALK calculates map match weight for all candidate (road) segments that the position can represent; a segment is defined as a vector between two adjacent shape-points and the segment with best map match weight is assigned as the map-matched road (Grid and Link in ALK mapdata). Information on Grid, Link and shape-points can be found in the ALK Mapdata documentation.  Map match weight computation is based on three factors. Firstly, how well the angle (heading and direction of travel) from the GPS observation corresponds to the angle of the road segment. It also depends on how well the speed value from the GPS observation correlates to default road speeds on the segment so that it will favor matching with Highway segments for faster speeds. Finally, there is a distance component to the map match weight so that the GPS observation is matched to a closer road segment than one that is farther away. 

OneMon dataset

Percent on the Link - Indicates point along the link from A-Node to B-Node where the GPS data is matched. 75.24 indicates 75.24% from A-Node and 24.76% from B-Node. This is independent of the direction of travel.

Description: OneMon is an ALK format and it stands for One Monument, where Monument refers to the mid-point of a link, and OneMon implying one representation of a vehicle per link when it crossed the mid-point.  It is a subset of GGD data with unique representation for each trip-link combination. When there are multiple observations for the traversal of a link by a single Trip ID (since GPS data is collected every three seconds), only the one closest to the center point of the link is retained and its date and time are interpolated to the time the vehicle would have actually passed the center point. The representative speed value of a Trip ID is computed based on the total travel time along the link and the distance of the link, in order to smooth out the instantaneous speeds over a link. This is done for each trip separately; hence if there are ten trips over that link, there would be ten data-points (same lat-longs, but different time stamps and speeds). This dataset helps in travel time analysis - by greatly reducing the number of GPS observations to work with for computing travel times over road segments for a single trip, and also by providing a consistent way to compare travel times and speeds from different trips on the same road segments.   

Additional documentation for Map Match Weight: For each GPS observation, ALK calculates map match weight for all candidate (road) segments that the position can represent; a segment is defined as a vector between two adjacent shape-points and the segment with best map match weight is assigned as the map-matched road (Grid and Link in ALK mapdata).
