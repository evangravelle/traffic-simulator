Native Data Set Environment:
In 2011 the USDOT Data Capture and Management program established contracts with four organizations to provide multi-modal, cleaned and “research-ready” data to support the development of Dynamic Mobility Applications.  The data set described herein was provided by Berkeley Transportation Systems (BTS), covering freeways in San Diego, CA for January through December 2010.  The delivered data sets have been placed in the RDE as a data environment.

There are six types of files in this data environment
• Freeway data: The freeway data consists of one full year (January – December 2010) of raw and cleaned data for over 3,000 traffic detectors deployed along 1,250 lane miles of monitored roadway in San Diego.  Data includes 30-second raw reports and 5-minute, hourly, and daily aggregations.  The data is provided via BTS’ Performance Measurement System (PeMS).  The data includes:
a. Flow
b. Occupancy
c. Speed
d. Vehicle miles traveled
e. Vehicle hours traveled
f. Travel time
g. Delay

• Incident and Lane Closure: These files document all incidents and lane closures that occurred during 2010 along Northbound Interstate 5 between mileposts 15 and 30, and along Southbound Interstate 5 between mileposts 10 and 25.  The incidents have been correlated to the nearest highway sensor.  The data includes:

Process Step 
Process Description:
BTS aggregated the raw (30-second) freeway data to 5-minute intervals, hourly intervals, and daily intervals. Where possible, missing values were imputed, using the procedure described in the freeway documentation.

GPS data was collected by ALK Technologies.  Identifying information was removed so that tracks cannot be correlated with any individual driver.

Attribute  
Attribute Label: Timestamp 
Attribute Definition:  Sample time as reported by the field element. This indicates the beginning of the reporting period. Character format as MM/DD/YYYY HH24:MI:SS.
Attribute  
Attribute Label: Station ID
Attribute Definition: Unique integer station identifier. Use this value to cross-reference with Metadata files.
Attribute  
Attribute Label: Freeway
Attribute Definition: Freeway on which the station is located (integer)
Attribute  
Attribute Label: Direction of travel 
Attribute Definition: Direction of travel measured by the station (1 character)
Attribute Domain Values: N, E, S, W
Attribute  
Attribute Label: Station Type
Attribute Definition: Two characters identifying the type of station
 Attribute Domain Values: OR = On ramp, FR = Off ramp, ML = Main line, HV = HOV lane, FF = Freeway-to-freeway connector.
Attribute  
Attribute Label: Samples   
Attribute Definition: Total number of samples recorded at this station and timestamp. This integer is the summation of all Lane "N" Samples.
Attribute  
Attribute Label: % Observed 
Attribute Definition: Percentage of individual lane points at this location that were observed (e.g. not imputed, or "filled in" when missing). Detailed information on imputation routines used to backfill missing data can be found in the Freeways Data Dictionary.   An individual lane point is a single set of measurements (e.g., flow and occupancy) for a single lane at a single time.
Attribute  
Attribute Label: Total Flow 
Attribute Definition: This integer is the sum of raw flows over all lanes during the 5-minute time period. Note that this basic 5-minute rollup normalizes flow by the number of good samples received from the controller. This normalization is necessary because some 5-minute periods may be made up of fewer than 10 30-second samples, for reasons related to slow running or out-of-sync data feeds. For periods with fewer than 10 samples, the summation of the flows reported in the good samples is multiplied by (10/number of good samples) to obtain the total flow that would likely have been reported had all 10 samples been present. Units are vehicles/5-min. Sample periods with no total flow are identified by '-1'. This is the only value for which blank entries are identified in this way.
Attribute  
Attribute Label: Average occupancy
Attribute Definition: Average occupancy across all lanes over the 5-minute period expressed in percentage. Computed to 4 decimal places as the average of the occupancies of all individual lanes during the 5-minute period.
Attribute  
Attribute Label: Average Speed 
Attribute Definition: Flow-weighted average speed over the 5-minute period across all lanes. If flow is 0, mathematical average of 5-minute station speeds. The flow-weighted average speed is the lane-by-lane average of speeds weighted by their flow. To compute this weighted average, divide the summation of the product of each lane’s speed and its flow by the sum of all flows. Units are mph, 1 decimal place.
Attribute  
Attribute Label: Lane “N” Samples
Attribute Definition: Integer number of good samples received for lane N. This is simply the number of 30-second timestamps with data that fall into this 5-minute period for this lane and location. N ranges from 1 to the number of lanes at the location. Lanes are numbered from inside (closest to the median) to outside.
Attribute  
Attribute Label: Lane “N” Flow 
Attribute Definition: Integer total flow for lane N over the 5-minute period normalized by the number of good samples. This normalization is necessary because some 5-minute periods may be made up of fewer than 10 30-second samples, for reasons related to slow running or out-of-sync data feeds. For periods with fewer than 10 samples, the summation of the flows reported in the good samples is multiplied by (10/number of good samples) to obtain the total flow that would likely have been reported had all 10 samples been present. Lanes are numbered from inside (closest to the median) to outside. Units are vehicles/5-min.
Attribute  
Attribute Label: Lane “N” Average Occupancy
Attribute Definition: Average occupancy for lane N over the 5-minute period expressed in percentage. This is the simple arithmetic mean of all raw occupancy values recorded for this lane and location during this 5-minute period. N ranges from 1 to the number of lanes at the location. Lanes are numbered from inside (closest to the median) to outside. Occupancy is expressed in percentage, with 4 decimal places.
Attribute  
Attribute Label:  Lane “N” Speed 
Attribute Definition: Flow-weighted average of lane N speeds, which are obtained from raw data by g-factor analysis described in detail below. The flow-weighted average speed is the weighted average of lane speeds by their flow. To compute this weighted average, divide the summation of the product of each lane’s raw speed and flow measurements by the sum of all flows for that lane during the time period. N ranges from 1 to the number of lanes. Lanes are numbered from inside (closest to the median) to outside. Units are mph, with 1 decimal place
Attribute  
Attribute Label: Lane “N” Observed  
Attribute Definition: 1 indicates observed data, 0 indicates missing data which may be imputed (or "filled in"). Detailed information on imputation routines used to backfill missing data can be found in the Freeways Data Dictionary. Note that PeMS does not impute for ramps. Lanes are numbered from inside (closest to the median) to outside.
